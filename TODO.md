# Todo

* Add Heroku friendly error handling/logging
* Proper business logic, particularly what the server sends when no gSheet URL is found
* How should we handle stats -> maybe a last-updated timestamp?
* Fix the flow - Keep the data cleaning function separate, this will change for each year
* Write docs for retirement
* Fix license
* Remove express dependency
